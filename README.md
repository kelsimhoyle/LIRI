# Liri Node App

Liri is a command line app which takes in two parameters: a command and a search. Liri then completes the commands and returns information back to the user in the terminal/bash and also logs it into a text file to be read.

There are four commands for Liri: "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", or "do-what-it-says"

## concert-this

When the user enters `node liri.js concert-this (band name)`, Liri uses the band name to search on the Bands In Town API. It will then return the venue, location, and date of upcoming concerts. This is also appended to the log.txt file.

This info includes the song name, album title, artists, and a link to the song preview on Spotify. This is also appended to the log.txt file.
